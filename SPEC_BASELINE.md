Changing any pinned identity requires:

1. an adopted SS-specs commit;
2. affected contract and task IDs;
3. fixture review;
4. an explicit version migration or fail-closed incompatibility;
5. this file and `ContractVersions.swift` updated together.

Legacy evidence is frozen at `scrimshawlife-ctrl/Surveillance-Survivor@3b20d88d6a6e1fe8f07f45f581359d371fa65d98`. Copying legacy files is prohibited. Bounded reimplementation must follow `legacy-admission.md`.

D-102 adoption: [SS-specs PR #61](https://github.com/Zero-State-LLC/SS-specs/pull/61). Merge the specification before this runtime change. Ruleset-006 replays fail closed; fixture review is in `docs/review/D102.md`.
